# Coordinate Conversion webapp

This repository contains the code for a web app i wrote as part of an assignment for the course "UxD-UIxD-M: Urban Interaction Design" during the winter term 24/25 at the University of Bamberg.

The main features are: conversion of coordinates between the three systems: Google KML (i.e. decimal degrees), EXIF (i.e. degrees, minutes, seconds) and NMEA 0183.

Additionally, coordinates formatted in any of those systems can be pasted, and the format will be detected.

Finally, the distance between any two points can be calculated (using the Haversine formula).

An online deployment is available: <https://layaxx.github.io/coordinate-conversion/>.
